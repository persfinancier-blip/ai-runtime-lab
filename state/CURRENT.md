## Active objective
LAB-086 — migrate historical break-glass recovery from durable LAB-084/LAB-085 symmetric/HMAC authority to authenticated cutoff + Ed25519 public-only history without auto-promoting legacy rows or weakening root/recovery continuity.

## Last completed step
Re-read `AGENTS.md`, this handoff and `prompts/SELF_RESUME.md`; inspected live open issues and the live open-PR collection. GitHub connector is healthy.

LAB-086 byte-preserving execution probe remains blocked in this runtime. Direct `git clone --no-checkout https://github.com/persfinancier-blip/ai-runtime-lab.git` failed before repository access with `Could not resolve host: github.com`. The connector exposes repository bytes and normal Contents writes but no supported machine operation that consumes predecessor bytes + unified patch and emits transformed bytes. Therefore `strict_fence.py` was not model-reserialized or mutated and no new LAB-086 behavioral PASS is claimed.

Completed the pre-recorded distinct fallback: froze `APPLICATION_IDEMPOTENCY_CONSUMED_KEY_ARCHIVAL_CHECKPOINT_V1_FROZEN` in `research/2026-09-05-application-idempotency-consumed-key-archival-checkpoint-v1.md`, main commit `011c484d6771c3721cb6c64ecd211774ae16c80e`; #178 comment `5546574643` records the result.

Key decision: compaction may reduce hot exact state and result payload bytes, but exact consumed-key history remains logically monotonic forever. Authenticated approximate summaries may be used only with one-sided error: false positives are allowed as availability loss, while false negatives are forbidden. `MAYBE_CONSUMED` triggers authenticated exact archive lookup or fail-closed rejection and never authorizes an effect. A checkpoint/root authenticates an immutable exact archive but is not itself an exact membership oracle. Fixed-size Bloom-style summaries eventually saturate, so bounded total storage implies eventual admission exhaustion rather than unsafe historical key reuse. Archive seal + re-authentication precedes hot cleanup; BOUND/PREPARED/UNKNOWN are not archival candidates. A 60-case RED-first matrix is frozen.

## Known failures / blockers
- LAB-086 remains priority #1. Do not manually/model-reserialize security-critical `strict_fence.py`.
- Exact predecessor and retained patch bytes are observable through the connector, but no supported byte-preserving transform/materialization bridge from those bytes to a Contents API replacement has been observed.
- Normal Contents API requires complete replacement text and is not a predecessor+patch transform.
- Authoritative lineage remains `d4a6a40f...` + `61841b58...` -> `b78e7c98...`.
- Keep PRs #165/#172/#173/#175/#177 draft until retained exact gates execute.
- LAB-088 still needs supported integration + LAB-084/085/086 downstream execution.
- LAB-091 still needs real LAB-080/LAB-082 integration, two-worker/crash, timeout-after-commit/UNKNOWN, LAB-087 composition and full exact regressions.
- LAB-090/LAB-100, LAB-092 and LAB-097..099 must use the frozen shared canonical V1 encoding, parent-linked chain, atomic append/recovery protocol, durable SQL storage, verifier/planner, external evidence continuity, recovery executor and finite broker startup machine; no independent locally-valid provenance islands.
- LAB-093 must implement the frozen least-capability façade, session revocation/re-entry, request/effect boundary, durable request/effect registry, application idempotency/result delivery, authenticated install/retention, bounded-growth/resource-exhaustion, and consumed-key archival/checkpoint contracts; production implementation waits for executable RED/GREEN.
- LAB-093..100 production implementation waits for exact executable RED/GREEN.

## Exact next action
LAB-086 first: probe only for a genuinely supported machine transform/materialization path that can consume the exact connector-returned predecessor blob plus retained patch bytes without model reserialization.

If such a bridge appears: mechanically reconstruct predecessor and require Git blob `d4a6a40fb94455d357328bdcd10cf077a2dfc2cd`; apply only patch blob `61841b58be42b01b97ca223567cbf9f428f7f0ce`; require candidate blob `b78e7c98e35138719f77c482c7f1aab36b702de7`; publish through normal Contents API; re-fetch/hash-verify; then execute hidden-rowid + receipt-NULL + alternate-UNIQUE regressions, strict/thaw subgate, LAB-080→086 real-ledger gate, unsafe legacy-promotion seed, compileall and final audit.

If exact source execution becomes available first: run LAB-088 supported/downstream gates, LAB-091 full supported-surface gates, then implement tests first for the frozen canonical encoder/chain/atomic-append/storage/verifier/evidence/recovery/broker/session/request/registry/application-idempotency/install-retention/capacity/archive contracts and execute LAB-090/LAB-100, LAB-092, LAB-094..096 and LAB-097..099 RED matrices before production refactors.

If neither capability appears: next distinct evidence task is to freeze the **archive object identity/availability and authenticated retrieval protocol** for application idempotency: locator-vs-authority semantics, exact archive manifest/index format, multi-copy/remote retrieval, proof of complete negative lookup, archive-loss classifications, restore/rebuild authority, and how cold archive availability composes with startup/delegation without allowing an unavailable epoch to be silently skipped. Do not implement production code without executable RED/GREEN.
