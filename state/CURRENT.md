## Active objective
LAB-086 — migrate historical break-glass recovery from durable LAB-084/LAB-085 symmetric/HMAC authority to authenticated cutoff + Ed25519 public-only history without auto-promoting legacy rows or weakening root/recovery continuity.

## Last completed step
Re-read `AGENTS.md`, this handoff and `prompts/SELF_RESUME.md`; inspected live open issues and PRs. GitHub connector is healthy and the retained LAB-086 patch blob can be read exactly, but no supported byte-preserving connector-response/predecessor+patch machine transform is exposed for security-critical `strict_fence.py`. A fresh direct `git clone --no-checkout` also failed before repository access with `Could not resolve host: github.com`. No LAB-086 branch mutation and no new behavioral PASS are claimed.

Completed the pre-recorded distinct fallback: froze `WORKER_SESSION_REVOCATION_REENTRY_V1_FROZEN` in `research/2026-09-04-worker-session-revocation-reentry-protocol-v1.md`, main commit `a25f80c3185cd562408e2162d27b9ead1e740e87`; #178 comment `5542576217` records the result.

Worker delegation is now temporally bound, not only structurally confined. Every delegated session is bound to a broker-owned session epoch, provider generation, LAB-100 activation-authority digest, authenticated provenance head, aligned terminal evidence and capability-profile digest. Revocation closes admission before any provider-generation / activation-authority / provenance mutation; queued work is cancelled, stale compute cannot publish after epoch change, and PREPARED/UNKNOWN operations transfer only to broker-owned exact-request recovery. Old sessions are never upgraded in place; restart invalidates every pre-crash session; re-entry requires a fresh full verify -> evidence -> NONE plan -> aligned/no-unresolved-activation gate and issues a new id/epoch/façade. A 50-case RED-first matrix is frozen.

## Known failures / blockers
- LAB-086 remains priority #1. Do not manually/model-reserialize security-critical `strict_fence.py`.
- Live predecessor/patch/target remain `d4a6a40f...` + `61841b58...` -> `b78e7c98...`; connector can fetch the retained patch blob, but no supported machine path from connector bytes + predecessor to exact transformed bytes has been observed.
- Normal Contents API requires complete replacement text and is not a predecessor+patch transform.
- Fresh direct Git transport in this run failed DNS before repository access: `Could not resolve host: github.com`; no exact repository behavioral PASS is claimed.
- Keep PRs #165/#172/#173/#175/#177 draft until retained exact gates execute.
- LAB-088 still needs supported integration + LAB-084/085/086 downstream execution.
- LAB-091 still needs real LAB-080/LAB-082 integration, two-worker/crash, timeout-after-commit/UNKNOWN, LAB-087 composition and full exact regressions.
- LAB-090/LAB-100, LAB-092 and LAB-097..099 must use the frozen shared canonical V1 encoding, parent-linked chain, atomic append/recovery protocol, durable SQL storage schema, startup verifier/planner, external-evidence continuity, recovery-executor grammar and finite broker startup state machine; no independent locally-valid provenance islands.
- LAB-093 must additionally implement the frozen worker-session revocation/re-entry protocol; production implementation waits for executable RED/GREEN.
- LAB-093..100 production implementation waits for exact executable RED/GREEN.

## Exact next action
LAB-086 first: continue probing only for a genuinely supported machine transform/materialization path that can consume exact GitHub predecessor + patch bytes without model reserialization.

If such a bridge appears: mechanically reconstruct predecessor and require Git blob `d4a6a40fb94455d357328bdcd10cf077a2dfc2cd`; apply only patch blob `61841b58be42b01b97ca223567cbf9f428f7f0ce`; require candidate blob `b78e7c98e35138719f77c482c7f1aab36b702de7`; publish through normal Contents API; re-fetch/hash-verify; then execute hidden-rowid + receipt-NULL + alternate-UNIQUE regressions, strict/thaw subgate, LAB-080→086 real-ledger gate, unsafe legacy-promotion seed, compileall and final audit.

If exact source execution becomes available first: run LAB-088 supported/downstream gates, LAB-091 full supported-surface gates, then implement tests first for the frozen canonical encoder/chain/atomic-append/storage/verifier/evidence-collector/recovery-executor/broker-state-machine/session-revocation contracts and execute LAB-090/LAB-100, LAB-092, LAB-094..096 and LAB-097..099 RED matrices before production refactors.

If neither capability appears: next distinct evidence task is to freeze the worker request-envelope + effect-boundary authorization protocol: canonical request identity/payload digest, read/compute versus effect methods, pre-dispatch and pre-effect session-state checks, duplicate/idempotent result delivery, cancellation semantics, and exact handoff from worker-originated request to broker-owned PREPARED/UNKNOWN recovery without allowing stale-session replay. Do not implement production code without executable RED/GREEN.
