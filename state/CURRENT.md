# Current Lab State

Last updated: 2026-09-03

## Active objective
LAB-086 — migrate historical break-glass recovery from durable LAB-084/LAB-085 symmetric/HMAC authority to authenticated cutoff + Ed25519 public-only history without auto-promoting legacy rows or weakening root/recovery continuity.

## Active issue / branch / PR
- Priority #1: #163 / LAB-086 — IN_PROGRESS; draft PR #165; branch `lab/086-asymmetric-break-glass-history`; observed head `ee210a47221b6df53f3518aa3af74f76c5b0122b`.
- Authoritative pending lineage: predecessor `d4a6a40fb94455d357328bdcd10cf077a2dfc2cd`; retained hidden-rowid patch blob `61841b58be42b01b97ca223567cbf9f428f7f0ce`; required composed target `b78e7c98e35138719f77c482c7f1aab36b702de7`.
- LAB-090 / #169 draft PR #175 remains IN_PROGRESS; LAB-092 / #176 draft PR #177 remains IN_PROGRESS; LAB-088 / #167 draft PR #172 and LAB-091 / #170 draft PR #173 remain IN_PROGRESS.
- LAB-093/#178 through LAB-100/#185 remain READY follow-ups as previously recorded.

## Last completed step
Re-read `AGENTS.md`, this handoff, `prompts/SELF_RESUME.md`, open issues and active PRs. LAB-086 was probed first.

The GitHub connector in this run returned both authoritative LAB-086 blobs completely by SHA: predecessor `d4a6a40f...` and retained patch `61841b58...`. The retained patch is confirmed to be the hidden-rowid hardening delta. A fresh direct Git clone was attempted and failed before repository access with `Could not resolve host: github.com`.

No available supported connector operation applies a unified diff to exact fetched blob bytes and returns a candidate byte stream/blob SHA. Because the publication contract requires byte-preserving composition and exact candidate blob `b78e7c98...`, no manual/model reserialization of security-critical `strict_fence.py` was attempted. No branch mutation and no fresh LAB-086 behavioral PASS are claimed.

Fallback source audit of PR #175 did not produce a new distinct issue beyond already-recorded LAB-090/LAB-098/LAB-099/LAB-100 authority/cleanup contracts in this run.

## Evidence produced
- `research/2026-09-03-lab086-full-blob-connector-capability-reprobe.md` — commit `159ad6ed9edab9ab870e8cb9fc244df53bed43b8`; #163 comment `5517818297`.
- Retained recent evidence: LAB-100 reconstructed-provider authority split `a610744c...`; LAB-090 concurrent duplicate release race `91ceccbb...`; COMMITTED-before-release audit `6e1e69b0...`; post-prepare connection leak `4c488991...`; caller-owned activation state `ee7b6ae0...`; inherited provider rotate `25297f0b...`; provider subclass authority `8b1abf6f...`; LAB-086 rowid semantics probe `04bdef2f...`; LAB-098 `6ac5525c...`; LAB-099 `3b6e311b...`.

## Known failures / blockers
- LAB-086 remains first priority. Do not manually/model-reserialize security-critical `strict_fence.py`.
- Exact predecessor and patch bytes are connector-readable, but this run still lacks a supported machine transform from connector blob + unified diff -> exact candidate bytes/blob SHA -> normal Contents write. Direct Git transport is transiently unavailable by DNS.
- Exact checkout/source execution remains unavailable; no fresh repository behavioral PASS is claimed.
- Keep PRs #165/#175/#177/#172/#173 draft until their retained exact gates execute.
- LAB-090 and LAB-093..100 regression contracts remain unchanged from prior state/issues.

## Exact next action
LAB-086 first: probe for a supported byte-preserving machine composition operation for predecessor blob `d4a6a40fb94455d357328bdcd10cf077a2dfc2cd` + retained patch blob `61841b58be42b01b97ca223567cbf9f428f7f0ce`. If available, apply only that patch, require candidate Git blob `b78e7c98e35138719f77c482c7f1aab36b702de7`, conflict-check PR #165 still contains the predecessor, publish through normal Contents API, re-fetch/hash-verify, then execute hidden-rowid + receipt-NULL + alternate-UNIQUE regressions, strict/thaw subgate, LAB-080->086 real-ledger gate, unsafe legacy-promotion seed, compileall and final security/reconciliation audit.

If exact source execution becomes available first, run the retained LAB-090 pre-fix RED set before PR #175 production changes, followed by LAB-098/099 and LAB-093..100 regression sets.

If neither becomes available, continue audit only for concrete distinct trust/capability/fail-closed violations not subsumed by existing issues; strengthen existing issues rather than creating duplicates.

## Backlog
- #163 / LAB-086 — IN_PROGRESS; exact hidden-rowid publication/full gate pending.
- #167 / LAB-088 — IN_PROGRESS; downstream execution pending.
- #169 / LAB-090 — IN_PROGRESS; exact behavioral/full gate pending.
- #170 / LAB-091 — IN_PROGRESS fallback; full behavioral gates pending.
- #176 / LAB-092 — IN_PROGRESS; exact regression/full gate pending.
- #178..#185 / LAB-093..LAB-100 — READY regression-first follow-ups.
