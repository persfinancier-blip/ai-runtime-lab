## Active objective
LAB-086 — migrate historical break-glass recovery from durable LAB-084/LAB-085 symmetric/HMAC authority to authenticated cutoff + Ed25519 public-only history without auto-promoting legacy rows or weakening root/recovery continuity.

## Last completed step
Re-read `AGENTS.md`, this handoff and `prompts/SELF_RESUME.md`; inspected live open issues and active PRs. GitHub connector is healthy.

LAB-086 byte-preserving execution probe remains blocked in this runtime. Direct `git clone --no-checkout https://github.com/persfinancier-blip/ai-runtime-lab.git` failed before repository access with `Could not resolve host: github.com`. The connector exposes exact blobs and normal Contents writes but no supported machine operation that consumes predecessor bytes + unified patch and emits the transformed bytes. Therefore `strict_fence.py` was not model-reserialized or mutated and no new LAB-086 behavioral PASS is claimed.

Completed the pre-recorded distinct fallback: froze `APPLICATION_IDEMPOTENCY_BOUNDED_GROWTH_RESOURCE_EXHAUSTION_V1_FROZEN` in `research/2026-09-04-application-idempotency-bounded-growth-resource-exhaustion-v1.md`, main commit `155db8f5bb3ba0678396ea36490ccab59217ab0c`; #178 comment `5545972991` records the result.

Key decision: permanent non-reuse of arbitrary application keys implies monotonic historical evidence, so V1 does not claim that fixed storage can admit unseen keys forever. Every new key consumes authenticated global/principal/namespace capacity before `BOUND`; hard exhaustion rejects unseen work before LAB-080 intent allocation, provenance PREPARED state, effect binding or provider call. Exact retries/lookups for already consumed keys still converge at capacity. `COMMITTED`/`TOMBSTONED` never refund permanent key slots; authenticated tombstoning may reclaim result bytes only. Capacity policy changes are authenticated parent-linked provenance events. Restart recomputes/re-authenticates usage and never resets it. Physical storage exhaustion is fail-closed and cannot authorize historical deletion/reuse. A 60-case RED-first matrix is frozen.

## Known failures / blockers
- LAB-086 remains priority #1. Do not manually/model-reserialize security-critical `strict_fence.py`.
- Exact predecessor and retained patch bytes are observable through the connector, but no supported byte-preserving transform/materialization bridge from those bytes to a Contents API replacement has been observed.
- Normal Contents API requires complete replacement text and is not a predecessor+patch transform.
- Authoritative lineage remains `d4a6a40f...` + `61841b58...` -> `b78e7c98...`.
- Keep PRs #165/#172/#173/#175/#177 draft until retained exact gates execute.
- LAB-088 still needs supported integration + LAB-084/085/086 downstream execution.
- LAB-091 still needs real LAB-080/LAB-082 integration, two-worker/crash, timeout-after-commit/UNKNOWN, LAB-087 composition and full exact regressions.
- LAB-090/LAB-100, LAB-092 and LAB-097..099 must use the frozen shared canonical V1 encoding, parent-linked chain, atomic append/recovery protocol, durable SQL storage, verifier/planner, external evidence continuity, recovery executor and finite broker startup machine; no independent locally-valid provenance islands.
- LAB-093 must implement the frozen least-capability façade, session revocation/re-entry, request/effect boundary, durable request/effect registry, application idempotency/result delivery, authenticated install/retention, and bounded-growth/resource-exhaustion contracts; production implementation waits for executable RED/GREEN.
- LAB-093..100 production implementation waits for exact executable RED/GREEN.

## Exact next action
LAB-086 first: probe only for a genuinely supported machine transform/materialization path that can consume the exact connector-returned predecessor blob plus retained patch bytes without model reserialization.

If such a bridge appears: mechanically reconstruct predecessor and require Git blob `d4a6a40fb94455d357328bdcd10cf077a2dfc2cd`; apply only patch blob `61841b58be42b01b97ca223567cbf9f428f7f0ce`; require candidate blob `b78e7c98e35138719f77c482c7f1aab36b702de7`; publish through normal Contents API; re-fetch/hash-verify; then execute hidden-rowid + receipt-NULL + alternate-UNIQUE regressions, strict/thaw subgate, LAB-080→086 real-ledger gate, unsafe legacy-promotion seed, compileall and final audit.

If exact source execution becomes available first: run LAB-088 supported/downstream gates, LAB-091 full supported-surface gates, then implement tests first for the frozen canonical encoder/chain/atomic-append/storage/verifier/evidence/recovery/broker/session/request/registry/application-idempotency/install-retention/capacity contracts and execute LAB-090/LAB-100, LAB-092, LAB-094..096 and LAB-097..099 RED matrices before production refactors.

If neither capability appears: next distinct evidence task is to freeze a compact consumed-key archival/checkpoint contract for application idempotency, explicitly analyzing whether any bounded representation can preserve the V1 no-false-negative/non-reuse property, how false-positive-only structures affect availability, how authenticated checkpoints compose with exact historical tombstone/provenance evidence, and why compaction must never silently convert a historical consumed key to `MISS`. Do not implement production code without executable RED/GREEN.
