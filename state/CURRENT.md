# Current Lab State

Last updated: 2026-09-03

## Active objective
LAB-086 — migrate historical break-glass recovery from durable LAB-084/LAB-085 symmetric/HMAC authority to authenticated cutoff + Ed25519 public-only history without auto-promoting legacy rows or weakening root/recovery continuity.

## Active issue / branch / PR
- Priority #1: #163 / LAB-086 — IN_PROGRESS; draft PR #165; branch `lab/086-asymmetric-break-glass-history`; observed head `ee210a47221b6df53f3518aa3af74f76c5b0122b`.
- Authoritative pending lineage: predecessor `d4a6a40fb94455d357328bdcd10cf077a2dfc2cd`; retained hidden-rowid patch blob `61841b58be42b01b97ca223567cbf9f428f7f0ce`; required composed target `b78e7c98e35138719f77c482c7f1aab36b702de7`.
- LAB-090 / #169 draft PR #175, LAB-092 / #176 draft PR #177, LAB-088 / #167 draft PR #172, and LAB-091 / #170 draft PR #173 remain IN_PROGRESS.
- LAB-093/#178 through LAB-100/#185 remain READY follow-ups.

## Last completed step
Re-read `AGENTS.md`, this handoff, `prompts/SELF_RESUME.md`, open issues and active PRs. LAB-086 was probed first. The connector can return the authoritative predecessor blob in full, but this run still has no supported byte-preserving connector-response -> machine file/transform handoff; security-critical `strict_fence.py` was not model-reserialized or mutated and no fresh LAB-086 behavioral PASS is claimed.

Fallback source audit of PR #175 found a concrete LAB-100 authority-boundary extension: `FencedActivationProvider` inherits `SignedAnchorProvider.rotate()` unchanged. A provider can therefore hold a live `ActivationState.pending` ticket and then have its provider_id/generation/key mutated outside the activation lock/state machine. Subsequent lifecycle calls reject the exact ticket via `_ticket_matches_runtime()`, while ordinary increment remains blocked by the stranded pending reservation. This strengthens existing LAB-100/#185 (and composes with LAB-093/#178), so no duplicate issue was created.

## Evidence produced
- `research/2026-09-03-lab100-inherited-provider-rotate-bypasses-activation-fence.md` — main commit `40f226a3ee41a512f05d9f03a8e972b230fcc4f3`; #185 comment `5522087162`.
- Retained LAB-086 machine-handoff evidence: `research/2026-09-03-lab086-container-download-handoff-probe.md` commit `3cc6187748211c8800a6a39d387aa5043f59b96d`; full-blob connector reprobe commit `159ad6ed9edab9ab870e8cb9fc244df53bed43b8`.
- Retained LAB-090 evidence includes post-prepare status/connection leaks, unavailable abort/status semantics, activation-id collision recovery, duplicate-release race, and pre-SQL external-commit orphan fence.

## Known failures / blockers
- LAB-086 remains first priority. Do not manually/model-reserialize security-critical `strict_fence.py`.
- Exact predecessor and patch bytes are connector-readable, but no supported machine transform/handoff currently composes connector blob + unified diff into exact candidate bytes/blob SHA for a normal Contents write.
- Exact checkout/source execution remains unavailable; no fresh repository behavioral PASS is claimed.
- Keep PRs #165/#175/#177/#172/#173 draft until their retained exact gates execute.
- LAB-090 fixes must preserve one trusted ownership/recovery scope from successful prepare through status, SQL durability, provider commit, durable acknowledgement and release; outage semantics must not invent provider evidence while unavailable.
- LAB-100 provider authority must also serialize/authorize inherited identity/key mutation. Do not fix the new inherited-rotate defect by swallowing `ActivationTicketMismatch` or clearing `pending`; identity/key/position/request-results/activation state must share one coherent provider authority or a verified safe transition protocol.

## Exact next action
LAB-086 first: probe for a supported byte-preserving machine composition/materialization path for predecessor blob `d4a6a40fb94455d357328bdcd10cf077a2dfc2cd` + retained patch blob `61841b58be42b01b97ca223567cbf9f428f7f0ce`. If available, apply only that patch, require candidate Git blob `b78e7c98e35138719f77c482c7f1aab36b702de7`, conflict-check PR #165 still contains the predecessor, publish through normal Contents API, re-fetch/hash-verify, then execute hidden-rowid + receipt-NULL + alternate-UNIQUE regressions, strict/thaw subgate, LAB-080->086 real-ledger gate, unsafe legacy-promotion seed, compileall and final security/reconciliation audit.

If exact source execution becomes available first, run retained LAB-090 REDs before PR #175 production changes and add the LAB-100 inherited-rotate RED: prepare exact ticket T, invoke inherited provider `rotate()` before activation completion, prove pre-fix identity changes while `pending == T` and reconciliation strands, then require the post-fix provider authority to block or safely serialize that transition.

If neither becomes available, continue audit only for concrete distinct trust/capability/fail-closed violations not subsumed by existing issues; strengthen existing issues rather than creating duplicates.

## Backlog
- #163 / LAB-086 — IN_PROGRESS; exact hidden-rowid publication/full gate pending.
- #167 / LAB-088 — IN_PROGRESS; downstream execution pending.
- #169 / LAB-090 — IN_PROGRESS; exact behavioral/full gate pending.
- #170 / LAB-091 — IN_PROGRESS fallback; full behavioral gates pending.
- #176 / LAB-092 — IN_PROGRESS; exact regression/full gate pending.
- #178..#185 / LAB-093..LAB-100 — READY regression-first follow-ups; #185 now explicitly includes inherited provider identity/key rotation during a live activation reservation.
