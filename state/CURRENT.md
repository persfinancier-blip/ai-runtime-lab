# Current Lab State

Last updated: 2026-09-05

## Active objective
LAB-086 — migrate historical break-glass recovery from durable LAB-084/LAB-085 symmetric/HMAC authority to authenticated cutoff + Ed25519 public-only history without auto-promoting legacy rows or weakening root/recovery continuity.

## Last completed step
Re-read `AGENTS.md`, this handoff and `prompts/SELF_RESUME.md`; inspected open issues and active PR state. GitHub connector is healthy. PR #165 remains open/draft at head `ee210a47221b6df53f3518aa3af74f76c5b0122b`.

Re-probed LAB-086 direct transport in this runtime: `git clone --no-checkout https://github.com/persfinancier-blip/ai-runtime-lab.git /tmp/ai-runtime-lab` failed before repository access with `Could not resolve host: github.com` (exit 128). Connector still exposes repository bytes and normal Contents writes, but no supported byte-preserving machine transform/materialization path was observed that consumes exact predecessor bytes + retained unified patch and emits the exact composed target. `strict_fence.py` was not model-reserialized/mutated; no new LAB-086 behavioral PASS is claimed.

Completed the recorded distinct fallback: froze `CHALLENGE_BLAST_RADIUS_QUARANTINE_EFFECT_CLASS_READMISSION_V1_FROZEN` in `research/2026-09-05-challenge-blast-radius-quarantine-effect-class-readmission-v1.md`, main commit `499e547f963a50bc7276ddf89b3e33ed6513cbf4`; #178 comment `5551416961` records the result.

Key decisions: quarantine is authority subtraction, not history mutation; compute the smallest safe provider/service/operation/account/region/adapter/effect-class blast radius from the authenticated dependency graph, widening on unknown dependencies; preserve independently trusted read-only reconciliation while removing SEND/MUTATE/RESUME/TOKEN_MINT authority; reject stale worker capabilities at the authoritative broker/ledger gate via current authority-generation binding; retain all historical application/provider identities as consumed; re-admission is a new parent-linked authority generation requiring challenge disposition, fresh capability evidence, complete dependency proof, provider semantics, namespace separation, safe conformance/drill evidence, independent quorum, restart verification, and any already-required owner authorization. Rollback/deletion of latest quarantine state cannot reactivate an older admitted generation. A 64-case RED-first matrix is frozen. No production code or behavioral PASS is claimed.

Primary donors recorded in the artifact: NIST SP 800-61 Rev.3 containment/recovery; NIST SP 800-53/53A least privilege/assessment; TUF threshold-root revocation/recovery; C2SP witness/checkpoint consistency and quorum policy.

## Known failures / blockers
- LAB-086 remains priority #1. Do not manually/model-reserialize security-critical `strict_fence.py`.
- Exact predecessor and retained patch bytes are observable through the connector, but no supported byte-preserving transform/materialization bridge to a Contents API replacement has been observed.
- Normal Contents API requires complete replacement text and is not a predecessor+patch transform.
- Authoritative lineage remains `d4a6a40f...` + `61841b58...` -> `b78e7c98...`.
- Keep PRs #165/#172/#173/#175/#177 draft until retained exact gates execute.
- LAB-088 still needs supported integration + LAB-084/085/086 downstream execution.
- LAB-091 still needs real LAB-080/LAB-082 integration, two-worker/crash, timeout-after-commit/UNKNOWN, LAB-087 composition and full exact regressions.
- LAB-090/LAB-100, LAB-092 and LAB-097..099 must use the frozen shared canonical V1 encoding, parent-linked chain, atomic append/recovery protocol, durable SQL storage, verifier/planner, external evidence continuity, recovery executor and finite broker startup machine; no independent locally-valid provenance islands.
- LAB-093 must implement the frozen least-capability façade, session/request/effect registry, application-idempotency/result delivery, authenticated retention/archive/DR/escrow/re-root/epoch/provider-capability/UNKNOWN-oracle/manual-resolution/canonical-evidence/challenge/quarantine contracts; production implementation waits for executable RED/GREEN.
- LAB-093..100 production implementation waits for exact executable RED/GREEN.
- No production post-reroot cutover, re-admission after trust discontinuity, or manual consequential re-attempt may be activated without required explicit product/security/business authorization bound to the exact payload/effect.

## Exact next action
LAB-086 first: probe only for a genuinely supported machine transform/materialization path that can consume the exact connector-returned predecessor blob plus retained patch bytes without model reserialization.

If such a bridge appears: mechanically reconstruct predecessor and require Git blob `d4a6a40fb94455d357328bdcd10cf077a2dfc2cd`; apply only patch blob `61841b58be42b01b97ca223567cbf9f428f7f0ce`; require candidate blob `b78e7c98e35138719f77c482c7f1aab36b702de7`; publish through normal Contents API; re-fetch/hash-verify; then execute hidden-rowid + receipt-NULL + alternate-UNIQUE regressions, strict/thaw subgate, LAB-080→086 real-ledger gate, unsafe legacy-promotion seed, compileall and final audit.

If exact source execution becomes available first: run LAB-088 supported/downstream gates, LAB-091 full supported-surface gates, then implement tests first for the frozen LAB-090..100 contracts and execute their RED matrices before production refactors.

If neither capability appears: next distinct evidence task is to freeze an **authority dependency manifest / policy compiler + static/runtime completeness verifier contract**. Define how consequential authority dependencies are declared from code/config/provider adapters; how the manifest is canonicalized, signed/versioned and bound to an exact build/runtime; how static analysis and runtime registration discover SEND/MUTATE/RESUME/TOKEN_MINT surfaces; how startup proves every consequential surface is dominated by the effective-authority gate; how omissions, dynamic dispatch/plugins/reflection and adapter drift fail closed; and how manifest evolution composes with quarantine/re-admission without allowing a stale or incomplete dependency graph to shrink blast radius.
